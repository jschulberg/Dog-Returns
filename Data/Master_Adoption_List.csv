Boca is doing well with socialization with dogs. He has been going to daycare on weekdays. He really enjoys it and tries to pull me into the daycare every morning. The daycare reports that he has come out of his shell and has a lot of fun playing with the other dogs there. Boca enjoys the dog park too as long as it's a smaller quiet crowd.

""Until today, he would walk away from me whenever I walked closer to him. Now he doesn’t feel the need to do this. He lets me pet him and massage him, lightly, behind his ears.""  When, during our walks, we meet another leashed dog that makes playful gestures toward Hobo, he reacts by wagging his tail and showing a real interest in playing with that dog. Hobo rarely vocalizes, even when my dog is barking at another dog. He follows my eleven-year-old dog around, and he has always been good to her. He may not prefer to be in the crate, but he doesn’t make a fuss. He has been following me around, lately, and this seems to be a sign of his feeling some bond with me. I have been somewhat concerned about his size and power, but he seems to be quite docile. At the dog park, he likes to play, run and otherwise interact with other dogs, but he is not comfortable with small children who run up to him to try to touch him. He is doing great with his house training. He is vocalizing more than he used to, which helps me to understand what is going through his mind. He is still shy, but he has made much progress in getting to trust people. He seems to do well in the crate.

Update 1/28/21-- Doing MUCH better with crate training; first week she wouldn't be able to settle for an hour but it's much less time now with the help of a kong/mealtime in the crate; LOVES to chew -- nylabones and stuffed animals are key; working on leash training as she can get overly excited about dogs and scared of humans; foster is working on clicker training with her and she's reading the body language of the resident dog to know when everything is okay and it's helping; going up the stairs now but definitely in part to the resident dog hleping; 

2/15/21 -- We have been testing Caramel with meeting friendly “strangers” since she’s so shy and she’s been with us for a few weeks now. She was very afraid of meeting a larger gentleman with a beard wearing a hoodie, so she may need some additional training in order to be around certain strangers. She’s doing well with the separation anxiety training, and is a high-energy dog so requires lots of playtime and long walks. We’re still working on her leash training as well since she’s a big puller!

He gets excited very quickly and easily. If he's not given boundaries, he'll stay at that high level of excitement which is probably when he was getting into trouble. He needs someone who will ask him to be patient and to be calm before he gets what he wants. With exercise plus clear rules in the home, he is very well behaved and does calm down.""","1/29/2021

Foster flagged that there have three incidents in the home of concern: 1. Around thanksgiving, family came over and Archer was behind a gate and he barked/growled at the people entering the home and when they reached over; he was able to meet them later on, attached to a leash 2. Was barking / jumping at the dog park towards other dogs -- foster thought it was agression so she left, but Ashley thinks (based on the body language described) it was either refereeing or an attempt to play cut short. 3. When the foster and Archer were sleeping on the couch, the foster woke up and startle Archer who snapped at the foster and got his chin - everyone was okay and Archer wasn't feeling well when this happened but is now on a caution on kids to be safe!! 

Brought back to LDAR due to ncreasingly leash reactive over the past couple of weeks. He recently knocked a man over when they came out of the elevator and wouldn't stop barking until they were back inside Ian's apartment. Archer does the same thing when encountering dogs on walks or around the building (barking and lunging, impossible to get him to refocus).

Exercise by foster -- 4 walks a day, leash training for 20 min, dog park 2x a week; ",2020-10-04 00:00:00,Altered,2021-01-15 00:00:00,2021-01-15 00:00:00,,2018-11-01,,,,,,

He has anti-anxiety meds, but I’ve refrained from giving him those if they don’t seem necessary. 4-6 walks/day, roughly 15-60+ minutes in length; He only really barks when he gets restless, playing with other dogs, or if he’s left out alone. Completely quiet and content in his crate. He’s usually content being near the human""

Second/New foster home -- thriving; no signs of reactivity to the point the foster hasn't seen any signs of reactivity we described; Does 3 miles a day on walks and a daily dog park trip; content to sit in the house while his foster works; doing well with training on basic tricks - sit, down, etc; struggling to maintain the furniture boundary; foster says Mikey 'craves exercise' and would love a foster home with a yard; entertains himself in the house with toys consistently; 

Update - 1/19: goes to the dog park frequently - struggles with jumping on them constantly which can cause other dogs to react, but Mikey is good; settles down in the crate after initial whining, fnatastic on walks and loves walking - pulls only for squirrles; foster noted that startling Mikey while he sleeps results in a reaction so definitely shouldn't be in a home with kids; Foster wants to stress exercse for him - long walk and nature hikes daily.",Altered,,2020-12-01 00:00:00,2020-12-01 00:00:00,2020-10-10 00:00:00,2018-09-07,2021-01-25,,,,,

She meets people and dogs well and has learned to play with select dogs.""

Update 12/2020 -- from foster: ""Best is like a new dog. For the first day, she would snap at me and other dogs, whoever tried to get near her. She was just scared. Now, she's totally fine with meeting people and playing with dogs. She loves running and is very affectionate. It would still be nice for her to go to her a home with a second dog, but I don't think it's a must. She and my other dog don't really interact anyway. I think it's probable that she will revert to her scared self when she moves to her adopted home for the first day or so....The new owners just need to have patience and give her her space.
