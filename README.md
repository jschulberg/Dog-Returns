## Problem Statement
For the final project, we will be analyzing a dataset from Lucky Dog Animal Rescue (LDAR), a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing homeless, neglected, and abandoned animals from euthanasia in kill shelters and getting them adopted into their forever homes. LDAR educates the community and all pet parents on responsible pet parenting, including the importance of spay/neuter, obedience training, and good nutrition.

Successful adoptions of cats and dogs depend on a variety of factors, both on the parts of the pet and of the family. LDAR helps bridge the gap, building strong relationships between the two. LDAR rescues hundreds of animals every year, provides them with loving temporary care, and finds them well-matched, carefully screened forever homes.

One of the struggles that Lucky Dog runs into is pets being returned after adoption. Even though they adopt out ~2000 dogs per year, about 10% get returned for a variety of factors. LDAR assiduously tracks information on all their adoptions and returns. With that, we will use various analytical methods learned in Computational Data Analysis to help Lucky Dog Animal Rescue predict whether or not a dog that they adopt out will be returned. 

## Data Source
The project will be overseen by Julie Brooks, Program Manager for Volunteers and Data Integrity at LDAR. She will provide the data needed for this analysis to we. Data will be provided using two official sources from LDAR, both of which contain records over the past decade, and can be easily linked by a unique ID field for each dog represented in each dataset. The two main data sources are:

**Dog List** | A list of every dog that has been adopted out by LDAR over the past 10 years. This list includes a variety of features describing each dog, where each row corresponds to a dog being adopted out, and each column represents a different attribute related to that dog. This dataset is composed of 10 spreadsheets, one for every year over the past decade. Each spreadsheet has records of ~2000 adoptions per year. The attributes in this dataset are as follows:

## Methodology
The goal of this project is to help keep dogs adopted by identifying dogs that are at risk of being returned. We will do this by building classifier models that classify the adopted dogs on whether they are returned vs. stay adopted, using the historical data we have about each dog.

### Data Preparation
To begin, we will have to process the data as it is not fully prepared for data analysis. Currently, all data is kept in a different spreadsheet by year (i.e. adoptions in 2021 are in the ‘Dog List 2021’; so we’ll have to programmatically combine all of our datasets. On top of that, the Dog and Returns Lists are kept as two separate data sources, but share a linking variable ‘ID’ for dogs that were returned. We’ll have to use a Left Join to find dogs that were returned; for any dogs which don’t have a match in the join, we’ll flag those as ‘Not Returned’.

There are also some issues with the features provided in the data. For example, the feature for ‘age’ is not standardized (written as weeks, months, or years) and is sometimes even written as an interval if the dog’s age is unknown, so we will need to standardize those features using one age marker. Additionally, some factors are described via text. For example, high energy dogs have the ‘description’ “walks not enough, needs play” - so we will attempt to identify those characteristics by scraping the text and then marking them as binary variables. We will also need to read in features like ‘breed’ as factor variables, in order for the model to read them correctly.  Following this initial preparation, we will standardize the numerical data using a python data scaling package to ensure certain features are not biased, such as weight vs. age. 

### Analysis
After preparing the data, we will analyze the data using the various classification models that we have learned so far in class including, but not limited to, Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. We will split the data into training, test, and validation sets, as we are using multiple models. By testing each of these methods, we hope to identify which one is most successful in classifying the adopted dogs as returned vs. not-returned. 

## Evaluation and Final Results
To evaluate our models, we will look at their classification/misclassification rates using a confusion matrix, as well as their precision, recall, and F1 scores. These metrics are essential in judging the outcome of a classification model, which is why we will use it to evaluate ours. We will compare the results of our test and validation sets in order to determine which model is the most accurate. We’ll also take note of the performance efficiency of each model.

If our models are accurate, they can be integrated into Lucky Dog’s systems to classify new dogs that come into LDAR. If a dog is classified into the return group, Lucky Dog can ensure that the dog is well matched with its new adopter, and reach out to the adopter to provide additional support to prevent the dog from being returned. We plan to construct this project so  that Lucky Dog’s data team can continue to use it, helping to place more rescued dogs in loving homes and keep them there.
